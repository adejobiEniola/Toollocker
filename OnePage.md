## What it is?

A simple tool lending tracker for workshops to help prevent borrowed tools from getting lost.

## Who is it for?

David, a busy workshop carpenter who lends expensive power tools to apprentices and neighboring artisans, then forgets who has what.

## What one job?

Help David keep track of who has each borrowed tool.

## Smallest version?

David can log in, record a tool loan, view outstanding loans, edit loan details, and mark a tool as returned.

## The screens

1. Authentication - signup with email and password, login, forgot password, and password reset through an email link. Logout returns the user to login.

2. Dashboard - shows only tool name, borrower name, expected return date, and status. Includes an Add Loan button, filters, and access to returned loan history.

3. Add / Edit Loan - enter or update the tool name, borrower name, phone number, and expected return date.

4. Loan Details - shows tool name, borrower name, phone number, borrowing date, expected return date, status, and return date if returned. Unreturned loans show Edit Loan and Mark Returned buttons.

<!-- ## What happens on each (userflows)

## What it is called

ToolLocker

<!-- ## Notes

- One workshop owner per account. Each owner sees only their own records.

- The website should work on both phone and laptop browsers.

- Tool names are typed manually, e.g. "Angle Grinder 1".

- Different physical tools should have distinct names, but the app does not need to enforce unique tool names.

- Each loan requires a tool name, borrower name, phone number, and expected return date.

- Required text fields cannot be empty or contain only spaces.

- No special maximum text lengths are needed beyond sensible normal input limits.

- Phone numbers are entered manually. No SMS verification or strict phone-number validation is needed.

- The borrowing date is recorded automatically and cannot be edited.

- Borrowing date, expected return date, and actual return date are stored and shown as dates only, not times.

- All date rules use Africa/Lagos time.

- For a new loan, the expected return date must be today or later.

- Editing updates the same loan record. The expected return date may be changed, including to a past date.

- No edit-history feature is needed.

- The dashboard initially shows all unreturned loans, including overdue ones.

- Statuses are Borrowed, Overdue, and Returned.

- Borrowed means the loan has not been returned and its expected return date has not passed.

- Overdue means the loan has not been returned and its expected return date has passed.

- A tool due today becomes overdue tomorrow.

- The status filter can show All Outstanding, Borrowed, Overdue, or Returned.

- All Outstanding means Borrowed and Overdue loans together.

- The optional date filter matches one exact expected return date and can be cleared.

- If status and date filters are both selected, the loan must match both.

- Outstanding loans are sorted by expected return date, earliest first.

- Returned loans are sorted by actual return date, newest first.

- The dashboard only shows tool name, borrower name, expected return date, and status. Phone number and borrowing date are shown only on Loan Details.

- Mark Returned asks for confirmation before completing the action.

- The confirmation can simply ask: "Mark this tool as returned?"

- Mark Returned records today's date automatically and changes the status to Returned.

- Returned records remain in history and are read-only.

- Returned Loan Details hide the Edit Loan and Mark Returned buttons instead of disabling them.

- Lending a returned tool again creates a new loan record.

- No delete, reopen, advanced search, or extra reporting features.

- Use the course's provided technology setup for authentication and saved data. Do not introduce a custom server or another backend technology.

- If the existing setup does not make the authentication or saved-data technology clear, ask instead of guessing.

- Records must remain saved after logout.

- Offline use is outside this version.
